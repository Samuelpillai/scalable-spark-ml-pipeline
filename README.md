# Scalable ML Pipeline with Apache Spark

This repository contains a modular and scalable machine learning pipeline built using **Apache Spark**. It demonstrates distributed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training for binary classification, regression, and multiclass classification tasks using PySpark’s MLlib.

---

## Key Features

-  End-to-end data pipeline with Apache Spark (PySpark)
-  Handles classification (binary & multiclass) and regression
-  Feature engineering with vector assemblers and transformers
-  Train/test split and evaluation with multiple metrics
-  Spark DataFrame-based EDA and visualization
-  Scalability for big data workloads

## Architecture Diagram

Below is the high-level architecture of the end-to-end Spark ML pipeline:

This repository contains a Spark Streaming application designed to process real-time-data from a Kafka topic. The project demonstrates a fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable streaming pipeline built using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Structured Streaming.
